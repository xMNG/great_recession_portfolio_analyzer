What if you retired right before the great recession? What would your withdrawals look like? This tool backtests your chosen allocation between Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX) or Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VBTLX). 

This tool was inspired by reddit's r/FIRE, r/leanfire, and r/personalfinance subreddits. Also inspired by a recent post on the bogleheads forums. And lastly, inspired by the recent declines in the market.
